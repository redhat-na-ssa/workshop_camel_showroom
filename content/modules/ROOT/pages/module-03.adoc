= Monitoring Integrations in OpenShift

There are different mechanisms to visualize real time/near real time information about a running Camel application. Let's learn two ways to monitor our Routes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this module you need the code generated on module 02. If you skipped that module, don't worry. 
Just checkout the `solution` branch and follow the README instructions in the folders.
====

== Using Hawtio

You have an instance of Hawtio installed for you in the `{user}-camel` namespace. Since we have at least one application ready, let's open your https://hawtio-online-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[HawtIO Console^].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will be asked to authorize this new service. Just use your credentials:

* User: `{user}`
* Password: `{password}`

and click on the authorize button.

This instance is configure to find pods in the namespace exposing ports named `jolokia`. To be able to connect to that port, the application needs to have a Jolokia endpoint enabled on it.
Click on the *Connect* button.

From the start you have the Camel menu open. You can see a breakdown of your Camel application. Routes, endpoints, components and data formats are all important elements that compose a Camel project. You can also see JVM information on the JMX and Runtime menus. We are going to focus on the Camel menu.

Click on the `kafka-to-expense-api` route. 

image::module03/hawtio-statistics.png[Routes Attributes]

You are presented with different tabs that allow you to have an understanding on the application current state. In the `Attributes` tab you can see different metric and the route configuration.

If you click on `Route Diagram` you can actually see how the Route structure looks like, much like when you were using Kaoto to build the route.

The graphical visualization plus the metric numbers will help you manage and troubleshoot the applications running in your namespace. 

== Using Prometheus and Grafana

We also provided a Prometheus instance to collect metrics from applications deployed in the namespace. You can visualize the pod in the `{user}-camel` namespace.

Even though Prometheus comes with a web console where you can query the metrics available, Prometheus alone does not offer a solution to create customizable dashboards that can display
the metrics in a meaningful way, that is why we need https://grafana.com/[Grafana^].

We already have an instance configure for you. We just needed you to enable the apps to export metrics.

Let's export these metrics using a PodMonitor. Apply the following configuration on the OpenShift cluster: 

.pod-monitor.yml
[source,properties,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
....
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: order-connector
  namespace: {user}-camel
spec:
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - bearerTokenSecret:
        key: ''
      path: /q/metrics
      port: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: order-connector  
....

[TIP]
====
You may use the command line to create this file using `oc apply -f filename` or you can use the OpenShift console + button.
====


Open your Grafana instance in a new tab using this https://grafana-route-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/dashboards[URL^].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will be asked to authorize this new service. Just use your credentials:

* User: `{user}`
* Password: `{password}`

and click on the authorize button.

image::module03/grafana-dashboard-menu.png[Dashboards]

Click on the `Camel - Quarkus` dashboard.

This is a simplified version of the metrics available when using the exporter. You can notice on the top that you can change the parameters to visualize the metric of different applications that have the same metrics, in this case, JVM and Camel Metrics. For now you only deployed `order-connector` but you could deploy other apps and use the same dashboard.

This is a very simple use case, just to demonstrate the art of possible. In a real word situation you will probably create custom metrics and enable them in the Route itself, but when that time comes, you already know how the Prometheus and Grafana configuration should look like.
