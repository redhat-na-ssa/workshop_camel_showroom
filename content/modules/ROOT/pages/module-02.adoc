= Developing Integrations with Camel

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this module, you will create the `order-connector` application (highlighted below in red) using the Kaoto graphical designer. If at any point you want to check your work, you can look at the solutions branch in your Git repository.

== The Use Case

Now is the time to actually implement integrations. For this module you will have access to a mock system called *Globex*, an e-commerce solution for Red Hat's swag. This system has a CDC(Change Data Capture) implementation to capture order and calculate cashback, but there is a missing piece that needs to be implemented to make the solution work. That is what you are going to do now.

Take a look at the system architecture. You are going to implement the component in red.
