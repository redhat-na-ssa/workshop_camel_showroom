= Customer Service
:table-caption!:

The Customer Service application will implement the Customer API. It'll give us a REST based interface to the `customer` table in the Customer DB.

image::module02/customer-service/architecture.png[]

Let's start by creating the `customer-service` folder under the `module-02` directory.

image::module02/customer-service/create-folder.gif[]

== OpenAPI Spec

Next, we'll create the OpenAPI spec defining our REST interface. For this, we'll be using the API Designer, a product based on https://www.apicur.io/apicurito/[Apicurito^] editor.

[TIP]
====
If you'd like to skip this step, you can grab the https://gitea.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{user}/workshop_camel_workspace/raw/branch/solution/module-02/customer-service/customer-openapi-spec.json[completed OpenAPIv3 spec^] from the solutions branch in your Git repo.
====

Open up https://apicurito-ui-shared-tools.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain} in a different browser tab, and create a new `OpenAPI 3` spec.

image::module02/customer-service/create-openapi-spec.gif[]

Name the API `Customers API`.

image::module02/customer-service/create-openapi-spec-name.gif[]

Create a new Data Type named `Customer`, and add the following JSON Example:

.JSON Example
[source,json,role="copypaste"]
....
{
    "customerId": "avandelay",
    "customerName": "Art Vandelay"
}
....

Make sure to select the box to create a new REST Resource for the Data Type. This will generate the paths and operations based on the JSON Example you entered in the box above. When you're ready, click `"Save"`.

image::module02/customer-service/create-openapi-spec-datatype.gif[]

You can view and edit the generated REST Resource. Select the `"Get"` operation under the `/customers` path. Change the Operation ID to `getCustomers` (_Note the CamelCase spelling_).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operation ID names are important. It is what will link the operation in the OpenAPI spec to the implementation route in Camel.
====

image::module02/customer-service/create-openapi-spec-edit.gif[]

Feel free to inspect the rest of the generated API spec. You can view it graphically, or look at the source code any given section. When you are satisfied, click the `"Save As..."` button, choose the `"Save as JSON"` option, and save the file somewhere on your machine.

image::module02/customer-service/create-openapi-spec-save.gif[]

Now switch back over to your Dev Spaces window. Create a new file in the `customer-service` directory named `customer-openapi-spec.json`. Paste in the contents of the OpenAPI spec file that you just saved locally.

image::module02/customer-service/create-file-openapi-spec.gif[]

== Application Properties

Now let's create our properties file like we did in the previous lab.

Create a new file in the `customer-service` directory. Name the file `application.properties`. Insert the following contents:

.application.properties
[source,properties,role="copypaste"]
[subs=normal]
....
db.serverName=cashback-db.{user}-globex.svc.cluster.local
db.port=5432
db.databaseName=cashback
db.user=cashbackmgr
db.password=cashbackmgr
....

image::module02/customer-service/create-file-properties.gif[]

== Camel Configuration

Next, we'll create the Camel configuration file. Unlike our previous app, this file will contain multiple Camel route definitions.

Create a new file in the `customer-service` directory. Name the file `customer-service.camel.yaml`. Open the file in the Kaoto editor.

image::module02/customer-service/create-file-camel.gif[]

Since this application will be interacting with a database, we'll need to create and configure a `javax.sql.DataSource` instance. We will then pass this bean reference to our Camel components in later steps.

Select the `Beans` tab in the Kaoto editor. Create a new bean with the following fields.

.Details
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Name|customerDb
|Type|org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource
|===

Expand the `Properties` section, and add the following:

.Properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|databaseName|{{db.databaseName:public}}
|password|{{db.password:Abcd1234}}
|portNumber|{{db.port:5432}}
|serverName|{{db.serverName:localhost}}
|user|{{db.user:user1}}
|===

image::module02/customer-service/create-bean.gif[]

=== Camel Route - `create-customer`

Now we can start on our first Camel route. The `create-customer` route will create a new customer in the database if one did not already exist.

Create a new Camel route and name it `create-customer`.

image::module02/customer-service/new-route-create-customer.gif[]

Edit the route start node. Change it from the default Timer Component type to a Direct Component type. Set the following Endpoint properties:

.Endpoint properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Name|createCustomer
|===

[NOTE]
====
As previously mentioned, the `Name` property of this Direct Component correlates to the Operation ID of the specific operation in the OpenAPI spec that we created in a prior step.
====

image::module02/customer-service/edit-route-create-customer-direct.gif[]

Next, we'll need to unmarshal the JSON data into a Java Object so that we can interact with it more easily. We can unmarshal the data into any structure, most commonly a POJO, but for simplicity we'll just use a hashmap.

Append an Unmarshal Processor step after the Direct Component step. Set the following properties:

.Properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Data Format|JSon
|Unmarshal Type|java.util.Map
|===

image::module02/customer-service/edit-route-create-customer-unmarshal.gif[]

Edit the Log Processor step. Set the following properties:

.Properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Message|Inserting customer: customer_id='${body["customerId"]}', name='${body["customerName"]}'
|===

image::module02/customer-service/edit-route-create-customer-log.gif[]

Now we'll insert the record into the database using the bean reference we created before. There are several ways to interact with a database (ie, JPA, JDBC, SQL, ... etc). Each of which have different syntax, but can accomplish the same task. We'll be using the SQL Component in the lab.

Append a new SQL Component step after the Log Processor step. Set the following Endpoint properties:

.Endpoint properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Query|INSERT INTO customer (customer_id, name) VALUES (:#customerId, :#customerName);
|Data Source|#customerDb
|===

image::module02/customer-service/edit-route-create-customer-sql.gif[]

Finally, we'll want to return nothing since that is the desired result of a successful `post` operation according to our OpenAPI spec.

Append a Set Body Processor step after the SQL Component step. Set the following Expression properties:

.Expression properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

|Type|Simple
|Expression|${null}
|===

image::module02/customer-service/edit-route-create-customer-setBody.gif[]

That's all for the `create-customer` route! Now let's see if you can create the remaining routes with a little less instruction and hand-holding. :)

=== Camel Route - `get-customer`

This route will get a single customer given a `customerId`, or return an HTTP `404` if the customer is not found.

== Running Application

As before, let's deploy/run this application as a Camel K integration. Notice that, in this case, we're actually going to create two ConfigMaps. One will hold our OpenAPI spec, and the other will hold our application properties.

Create the OpenShift ConfigMap, then run the Camel K Integration. To do so, open a terminal and run the following commands:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that you're logged-in to OpenShift as `{user}` and in the correct `{user}-camel` project/namespace.
====

[source,shell,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
cd $PROJECT_SOURCE/module-02/customer-service
oc create configmap customer-service-config --from-file=application.properties
oc create configmap customer-openapi-spec --from-file=customer-openapi-spec.json
kamel run -d camel:platform-http -d mvn:org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.3 -p configmap:customer-service-config --open-api configmap:customer-openapi-spec customer-service.camel.yaml
----

image::module02/customer-service/run-camel.gif[]

That's all for the Customer REST API implementation. As before, you should see your `customer-service-*` pod start within a few minutes. And also as before, be patient while the Camel K operator runs a build and deploy.

== Testing Application

Since this is a REST service, you can use `curl` (or whatever your HTTP REST testing tool of choice) to test this application. I'll give instructions for `curl` since it's already available in our environment.

Open a terminal and issue the following commands:

.create-customer
[source,shell,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "customerId": "avandelay", "customerName": "Art Vandelay" }' http://customer-service-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/customers
----

.get-customer
[source,shell,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' http://customer-service-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/customers/avandelay

# You can also pass the '-v' flag to see the HTTP headers and verifiy that it returns a 404 in the case of a non-existent customerId.
----

.get-customers
[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
[subs=normal]
----
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' http://customer-service-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/customers
----

.update-customer
[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
[subs=normal]
----
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "customerName": "Arthur Vandelay" }' http://customer-service-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/customers/avandelay
----

.delete-customer
[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
[subs=normal]
----
curl -X DELETE http://customer-service-{user}-camel.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/customers/avandelay
----
