= Getting Started with the Workshop

In this module you will get familiarized with the resources available to you in this workshop. 


== Accessing OpenShift

All the tools and resources you need to execute this workshop are available in OpenShift, so to get started, let's log in OpenShift. 


[IMPORTANT]
====
Here are the access details:

* Console URL: {console_url}
* User: `{user}`
* Password: `{password}`
====

Open the console URL link in another tab. Now you just need to enter your User and Password and click on "Log in" button.

This will take you to the initial page. This page will show you what projects(namespaces) are available to you:

== Projects available to you

In this workshop you will interact with 3 different projects. Let's learn about them.

=== {user}-globex

This is our mock e-commerce system. We will wire integrations to it to add functionality to the system. You are able to visualize what is in the project, but you are not able to change things.

=== {user}-devspaces

Your IDE workspace is running here. You are able to visualize it but are not able to change it.

image::module01/devspaces-namespace.png[Globex Namespace]

=== {user}-camel

This is the project you'll use to deploy integrations. We already have some operators set up for you. You'll use them in the upcoming modules.

== Using Dev Spaces

Let's get used to our IDE. Go back to the OpenShift {console_url}[console]. In the top right corner, click on the grid, then select `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces`.

image::module01/link-devspaces.png[Link Dev Spaces]

Once you click, you will be asked to authenticate again and authorize the service to access your user account.

image::module01/authorize-devspaces.png[Authorize]

Click on `Allow selected permissions`. That will take you to the Dev Spaces dashboard.

image::module01/devspaces-dashboard.png[Dashboard]

To start using the workspace, click on the open button.

image::module01/workspace-first-login.png[Workspace]

Since this is your first time opening the IDE, you will be required to perform some basic configuration, like trusting the workspace authors. You may also set the theme for the IDE.

Some popups will show up about permissions to share data. You may deny all of them.

== Starting with a HelloWorld Route

=== Creating the Route

Before we start to develop real integrations, let's get a feel for the tooling available by starting with a stock HelloWorld application. We can now use VS Code extensions to initialize a Camel Route for us. 

* Use `CTRL + SHIFT + P` to open the command pallete 
* Type in `camel yaml dsl`
* Select `camel:Create a Camel Route using YAML DSL`.
* name the Route `sample-route`
* A terminal will open. Type `3` and hit enter to enable JBang to download content.

Once the downloading is done, you should have a file named `sample-route.camel.yaml` in the project root.

The file will be open using one of the VS Code extensions pre-configured for you, Kaoto. https://kaoto.io/[Kaoto^] is a graphical editor for Camel Routes. We will use it to build integrations using no-code/low-code.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A Route is a set of processing steps that are applied to a message as it travels from a source to a destination. A route typically consists of a series of processing steps that are connected in a linear sequence.A Camel route is where the integration flow is defined. For example, you can write a Camel route to specify how two systems can be integrated. You can also specify how the data can be manipulated, routed, or mediated between the systems. 
====

In this example we have a simple route that starts with a https://camel.apache.org/components/4.4.x/timer-component.html[Timer^] event. So every second a new event will be generated and a message will be logged. Let's run this example locally first.

=== Running Routes Locally

To run this Route we are going to use a tool called JBang. https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang.html[JBang^] is a CLI that makes easy to run Java applications. You already have the VS Code extension configured for you and the JBang CLI available in your workspace. Let's run the route.

* If you have the editor open, you can run it by clicking on the `Run Camel Application with JBang` button on the top right corner:

image::module01/run-jbang-01.png[JBang button]

* You can also right click on the file name and select `Run Camel Application with JBang`.

It takes a couple of seconds to run routes for the first time, as dependencies need to be downloaded and stored locally. Once the route starts to run, you will see logs in your terminal:

image::module01/route-running.gif[Route Running]

This route will run indefinetely, generating messages every second, so once you're done with the demonstration, `CTRL + C` on the terminal to stop the process.

=== Deploying the route using Camel K

We also have a tool to make this deployment as easy as it was to run it locally. The tool is Camel K.
Camel K is built from Apache Camel, allowing it to run natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

The VS Code extension and the CLI are already configured in the environment, but before we deploy, let's make sure you are connected to the OpenShift cluster and using the right project.

* Open a new terminal window
* To make sure you're logged with the right user, run `oc whoami`. Expected to see `{user}`. If you are not logged, you can follow the steps in the xref:troubleshooting-guide.adoc[troubleshooting guide].
* Now let's configure the right project. In the terminal run `oc project {user}-camel`

image::module01/setting-project.gif[Setting Project]

To deploy the Route you can use the icon in the top right corner(next to the JBang icon we used previously).

* Click on the rocket icon to launch the deployment
* Select `Basic` deployment
* Note the `APACHE CAMEL K INTEGRATIONS` tab on your left. 

image::module01/vscode-camel-k-panel.png[Camel-k panel]

Once the deployment starts, you will see a route name with a red dot in front of it. This means the build is happening but the Route is not running

* When the Route dot turns green, it means it's running. Now you can check the logs by right clicking on the route name and selecting `follow logs for Apache Camel K Integration`.

You can check the execution with the following gif:

image::module01/deploy-route.gif[Deploy royte]

Since our work will be persisted using git, let's create a folder for this first module. Name it `module-01`. You can follow the steps with the gif below:

image::module01/create-folder.gif[Create folder]

With the folder created, move the `sample-route.camel.yaml` file to the folder.

== Accessing Gitea

You noticed that when you opened the workspace you already had a project loaded in there.
Each user in this workshop has its own git repository and workspace. You will use this repository to have access to configuration and the final solution for each module, but you also are going to use it to push code you generate.

Use the link and credentials below to access Gitea:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Repository URL: {gitea_console_url}/{user}/workshop_camel_workspace
* User: `{gitea_user}`
* Password: `{gitea_password}`
====

image::module01/gitea.png[Gitea]

Once you were able to check your access to Gitea, let's go back to your workspace and use git there.

=== Pushing code 

Before finishing this module you need to push your changes to the git repo assigned to your user. The configuration is already done for you, so you just need to add your `username` and `password` when asked. You can follow the steps on the gift:
