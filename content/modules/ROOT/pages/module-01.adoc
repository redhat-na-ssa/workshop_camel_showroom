= Getting Started with the Workshop

In this module you will get familiarized with the resources available to you in this workshop. 


== Accessing OpenShift

All the tools and resources you need to execute this workshop are available in OpenShift, so to get started, let's log in OpenShift. 


[IMPORTANT]
====
Here are the access details:

* {console_url}[OpenShift Console Link^]
* User: `{user}`
* Password: `{password}`
====

Open the console URL link in another tab. Now you just need to enter your User and Password and click on "Log in" button.

This will take you to the initial page. This page will show you what projects(namespaces) are available to you:

== Projects available to you

In this workshop you will interact with 3 different projects. Let's learn about them.

=== {user}-globex

This is our mock e-commerce system. We will wire integrations to it to add functionality to the system. You are able to visualize what is in the project, but you are not able to change things.

=== {user}-devspaces

Your IDE workspace is running here. You are able to visualize it but are not able to change it.

=== {user}-camel

This is the project you'll use to deploy integrations. We already have some operators set up for you. You'll use them in the upcoming modules.

[NOTE]
====
Your Topology image topology/layout may look different or be organized differently, but all the same components will be present.

== Using Dev Spaces

Let's get used to our IDE. Go back to the OpenShift {console_url}[console]. In the top right corner, click on the grid, then select `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces`.

Once you click, you will be asked to authenticate again and authorize the service to access your user account.

image::module01/authorize-devspaces.png[Authorize]

Click on `Allow selected permissions`. That will take you to the Dev Spaces dashboard.

To start using the workspace, click on `yes, I trust the authors` button.

image::module01/workspace-first-login.png[Workspace]

Since this is the first time you open this IDE, you will be required to perform basic configuration, like trusting the workspace authors, set the theme and permission to share usage data. You may deny all of them.

== Starting with a HelloWorld Route

=== Creating the Route

Before we start the development of the `order-connector`, let's get started by running the hello-world example available in our template project.

On your left it's the workspace explorer, let's open the the Camel Route. Click on the file `order-connector/src/main/resources/camel/route.camel.yaml`.

The file will be open using one of the VS Code extensions pre-configured for you, Kaoto. https://kaoto.io/[Kaoto^] is a graphical editor for Camel Routes. We will use it to build integrations using no-code/low-code.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A Route is a set of processing steps that are applied to a message as it travels from a source to a destination. A route typically consists of a series of processing steps that are connected in a linear sequence.A Camel route is where the integration flow is defined. For example, you can write a Camel route to specify how two systems can be integrated. You can also specify how the data can be manipulated, routed, or mediated between the systems. 
====

In this example we have a simple route that starts with a https://camel.apache.org/components/4.4.x/timer-component.html[Timer^] event. So every second a new event will be generated and a message will be logged. Let's run this example locally first.

=== Running Routes Locally

Since this template is a Quarkus project, we are going to use Maven to run this application locally.
The first step is to open a terminal. You can open on by following the example in the gif:

image::module01/open-terminal.gif[Opening Terminal]

In the open terminal, run the following commands to run the route locally:

----
cd order-connector
mvn package quarkus:run
----

Dependencies will be downloaded to build the application. This will take 2 minutes or so. Once that is done, you will see `Hello World` messages logged in the terminal. Like in the gif:

image::module01/quarkus-running.gif[Quarkus Running]

You can stop the route execution by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal.

In the next module we will make changes to the route to satify our use case.

== Accessing Gitea

You noticed that when you opened the workspace you already had a project loaded in there.
Each user in this workshop has its own git repository and workspace. You will use this repository to have access to configuration and the final solution for each module, but you also are going to use it to push code you generate.

Use the link and credentials below to access Gitea:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* {gitea_console_url}/{user}/workshop_camel_workspace[Repository Link^]
* User: `{gitea_user}`
* Password: `{gitea_password}`
====

image::module01/gitea.png[Gitea]

Once you were able to check your access to Gitea, proceed to the next module.
