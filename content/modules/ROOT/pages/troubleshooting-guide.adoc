== OpenShift Forbidden Error

When executing any command or Task in the DevWorkspace's Terminal...
If you see any error similar to the following:


`Error from server (Forbidden): ... is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:{user}-devspaces:workspace53028c69c2b54fa5-sa" cannot get resource ... in API group ... in the namespace "system:serviceaccount:{user}-...`


It may happen your DevWorkspace was not able to inject your user information properly during its initialization.
To solve that issue, from the IDE *Task Manager*, execute the *Task* named `02: OC Login`.
