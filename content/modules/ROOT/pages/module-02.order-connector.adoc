= Order Connector
:table-caption!:

The Order Connector application will pull JSON order messages from a Kafka topic and post them to the existing Expense REST API.

== Application Configuration Properties

The `application.properties` file can be used to externalize variable values in our application. Things like credentials, URLs and runtime configuration. You can have as many files as you need, and they can be applied as files, ConfigMaps, or Secrets, as appropriate. 

A application.properties file is already available for you and it contains basic configuration we need to run and deploy this application. We will still need to provide use case specific properties.

image::module02/order-connector/application-properties.png[Application Properties]

Copy the following entries to your properties file:

.application.properties
[source,properties,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
....
kafka.brokers=kafka-kafka-bootstrap.{user}-globex.svc.cluster.local:9092
kafka.securityProtocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
kafka.saslMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-512
kafka.saslJaasConfig=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username='globex' password='globex';
cashback-service.url=cashback-service.{user}-globex.svc.cluster.local:8080
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure when copy/pasting, you only grab the actual text and not any erroneous tabs, spaces, or new lines.
====

== Camel Configurations

The Camel configuration file will hold our Camel route definitions. If you're familiar with Camel, you know that there are many ways to define your Camel routes (ie, Java, XML, YAML, ... etc). These are known as DSLs(Domain Specific Languages). In general, you can use whichever one you're most familiar with. However, since we plan to develop these apps using Kaoto graphical editor, we'll be using the YAML DSL.

We are going to edit the `route.camel.yaml` file. Open the file with the Kaoto editor by clicking on it.

[NOTE]
====
If the Kaoto extension is installed, it will by default detect and open any files matching the `*.camel.yaml` naming pattern. If you want to open the file in any other editor (ie, the plain text editor), you can right-click on the file, select `"Open With..."`, and then choose your desired editor.
====

Edit the name of the route and set it to `kafka-to-expense-api`.

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-name.gif[]

[TIP]
====
It's always a good idea to give your Camel routes useful names. This helps you to identify them later when viewing them in the Hawtio web console.
====

Edit the route first node. Change it from the default `Timer Component` to a `Kafka Component`.

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-kafka.gif[]

Set the following endpoint properties on the Kafka Component node:

.Endpoint properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

.^|Topic|globex.order-aggregated
.^|Brokers|{{kafka.brokers}}
.^|Auto Offset Reset|earliest
.^|Group Id|order-cashback-connector
|===

.Security properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

.^|Sasl Jaas Config|{{?kafka.saslJaasConfig}}
.^|Sasl Mechanism|{{?kafka.saslMechanism}}
.^|Security Protocol|{{?kafka.securityProtocol}}
|===

[NOTE]
====
You may have noticed the `{{property.name}}` syntax for some of the values. This allows us to reference the properties we defined in our `application.properties` file earlier. This syntax allows you to reference properties, define defaults should the properties not exist, and even selectively set an option based on whether or not a property is set. For more information on the syntax and capabilities, take a look at the https://camel.apache.org/manual/using-propertyplaceholder.html[docs^].
====

Set the following properties on the Log Processor node:

[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

.^|Message|Picked up customer aggregated order message: '${body}'
|===

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-log.gif[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
As with many things in Camel, there is usually more than one way to accomplish the same task. For instance, there is both a `Log Component`, and a `Log Processor`. Both serve the purpose of logging a message, just with slightly different configurations. ##In all of these labs, we will use the **Log Processor** for consistency##.
====

[NOTE]
====
Notice that you can insert Camel Simple expressions into the log message. For more information about Camel Simple expression language, take a look at the https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/languages/simple-language.html[docs^].
====

Append a `Remove Headers` node after the `Log Processor` node

image::module02/order-connector/remove-headers.gif[]

[NOTE]
====
Certain endpoints will return data in the body and hearders of messages. If you don't want headers to be propagated to another endpoint, you need to remove them or set specific configuration in the next endpoint.
====

Append a `Choice Processor` node after the `Remove Headers` node.

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-choice.gif[]

Set the following properties on the "when" condition:

[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
[separator=:]
|===
:Name:Value

.^:Type:Simple
.^:Expression:${body} == ${null} || ${body} regex "\s*"
|===

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-choice-when.gif[]

Insert a `Stop Processor` step under the "when" branch.

image::module02/order-connector/edit-route-choice-when-stop.gif[]

Insert a `Rest Component` step under the "otherwise" branch.
Set the following endpoint properties on the `Rest Component` node:

.Endpoint properties
[%autowidth, cols="d,l"]
|===
|Name|Value

.^|Method|post
.^|Path|/expense
.^|Binding Mode|off
.^|Host|{{cashback-service.url}}
|===

== Running Application

We are going to run the application in the same way we run the initial example. Open a new terminal and run:

[source,shell,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
cd $PROJECT_SOURCE/order-connector
mvn package quarkus:run
----

And that's it! If all went well, you should logs like in the image:

image::module02/order-connector/app-running.png[]

Let the application running. We will test it next.

== Testing Application

* If you want to simulate a larger number of orders, you can use the _Order Simulator_ application deployed in the `{user}-globex` namespace on OpenShift, using this https://order-simulator-{user}-globex.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[link^].

** This opens a Swagger UI page showing the REST API of the simulator. +
Click on the *POST* link, and then on the *Try it out* link on the right. From the *Examples* drop down, select *random customers* to create orders for random customers. Feel free to change the numbers of orders you want to simulate (the default is 50).
+
image::module02/end-to-end-test/order-simulator-random-customer.png[]

** Click *Execute* to execute the REST call to the simulator.
** Check in AMQ Streams Console that new messages are produced to the *globex.updates.public.orders* and *globex.updates.public.line_item* topics.

[NOTE]
====
The input messages are "windowed" by a Kafka Streams pre-processor application. So it might take about 10-15 seconds for them to come through.
====

Once the messages are aggregated and set to Kafka you should see log entries like these:

image::module02/order-connector/kafka-messages.png[]

== Deploying the application using Quarkus OpenShift plugin

If you have the application running on VS Code stop it. Let's deploy it on OpenShift.

In the terminal, run the following commands:

[source,shell,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
oc project {user}-camel
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

If everything occurred as expected, you should see a `BUILD SUCCESS` message in the terminal.
